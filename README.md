Many cyber attacks take place each day out of which website phishing is the most common issue. It is an act of imitating a legitimate website and thereby duping the users and stealing their sensitive information. So, with respect to this problem this paper will introduce a possible solution in order to avoid such attacks by checking whether the provided URLs are phishing URL or legitimate URL. It is basically a Machine Learning based system particularly supervised learning where we have provided 2000 phishing and 2000 legitimate URL dataset. We have taken into consideration Random Forest algorithm due to its performance and accuracy. It takes 9 features into consideration and hence detects whether the URL is safe to access or a phishing URL.
